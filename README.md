# Welcome to Tech Gather NYC
Tech Gather NYC is a mixer for anyone and everyone in NYC Tech.

Just got to the city? Get to know the techies here!
Been here forever? Grab your "Pizza Rat" headband and welcome the newbies.

Be you Product, UI, Coder or Solutions or any of the buzz terms our industry throws out there, come unwind at a chill Irish pub on Fulton with cheap drinks and stay for a top-notch (free!) karaoke session next door.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
